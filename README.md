# Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a method in deep learning where the details of one picture are combined with the artistic style of another to create a new image. This process allows you to generate an image that has the subject of the first picture but the art style, colors and textures of the second. 
# I would recommend exploring NST to mid-beginners in the field of deep neural networks and its beauties.
